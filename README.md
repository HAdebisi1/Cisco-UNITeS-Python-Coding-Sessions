# unites-python-class
These are the code examples carried out during the python class  hosted by UNITeS Cisco. They are divided into branches based on the classes we had. This is an overview of the activities within those branches and links to get more information regarding the discussed concepts.

# Setup
If you would like to have the code examples in your system, all you need to do is to clone this repo into you computer through git on your computer. To do that:
- Install github into your computer system. Visit the [Github CLI website here](https://cli.github.com/) to download the given package. You may also want to do download the [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) so you have a GUI to interact with your repositories online.
- In your terminal (After the github is installed), clone this repo into a folder of your choice. To do this, open the folder you want to save this repo into. ([Check here to get familiar with some terminal commands to make this easier.](https://github.com/dominionikpeawujor/unites-python-class/blob/day-1/DAY%201/day-1/day-1.py) -  The first lines to know how you can open folders in the terminal)
